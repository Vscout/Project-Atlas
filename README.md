# Project-Atlas
Initial Map Functionality

//Below is the code written so far in Swift and I am using Xcode 8.2.1. I am trying to build a map/navigation application. My //initial desired functionality is to use Mapbox in the Main.Storyboard (rather than MapKit) and then CoreLocation to handle //the functionality of the GPS chip (i.e pulling latitude, longitude, accuracy, speed, etc.).

//Here is where I'm having difficulty: I was able to successfully import Mapbox and CoreLocation, however once I tried to center the map on the user's latitude and longitude, this is where the errors began. I am simply trying to have the map zoom in on the user latitudes and longitude and ultimately have tracking functionality available as well. At some point I want able to build the simulated app and it was printing the latitude and longitude perfectly fine in the Out area. Once I added in code to center the mapView, that is where I ran into issues. To further complicate the process, the tutorial I have been viewing was written for MapKit so I have had to translate MapKit code to Mapbox code as necessary.

//Here is the code. Any help letting me know what I am doing wrong is greatly appreciated:
